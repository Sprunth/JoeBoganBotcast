# Joe Bogan "Botcast"

A toy project that generates "botcasts" from machine-generated text based off of the Joe Rogan Podcast.

### The steps
- Auto-transcribe the podcast audio into text including speech diarization
- Machine learn against the transcribed text, and generate new text
- Train voice models using the podcast
- Synthesize speech and have "Joe Bogan" and guests speak the new generated text
